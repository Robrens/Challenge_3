            <p>Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?</p>
            <p>You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline. But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you
            catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.</p>
